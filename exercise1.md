# Continuous Integrations/ Continuous Delivery

In software development, deploying a new feature or code update involves several crucial steps. These include Linting, ensuring clean and readable code; Building, bundling the code into a runnable software form; Testing, to prevent any disruptions to existing features; Packaging, and ultimately, Deploying to the world. This collective process is commonly referred to as Continuous Integration (CI). For JavaScript developers using React or Node.js, there are specific tools available for each step.

ESLint is a popular choice for Linting, offering versatility including the use of a Typescript parser for Linting Typescript codes. Webpack and Parcel are common tools for Building, along with Babel for bundling and transpiling modern JavaScript code for broader browser compatibility. Testing is facilitated by tools like Jest, favored for its speed and simplicity in Unit Testing, and Cypress for comprehensive end-to-end testing. Mocha provides flexibility, accommodating Unit, Integration, and End-to-End Testing.

Numerous tools and pipelines automate the CI process. Jenkins and GitHub Actions, as self-hosted and cloud-based options respectively, are widely used. Additionally, there's a range of CI/CD service providers including GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps, AWS CodePipeline, and Google Cloud Build. The choice of platform hinges on project-specific needs, development stack preferences, and integration requirements.

For a small team of six developing a new app, a cloud-based environment is generally recommended over a self-hosted one. Cloud environments offer cost-effectiveness due to their pay-per-use model, as opposed to the substantial upfront investments required for self-hosting. This approach is particularly advantageous for new or smaller businesses seeking efficient development. Cloud services often come pre-equipped with pipelines that can be swiftly configured. Additionally, server maintenance and security responsibilities are handled by the cloud provider. With only six team members, this setup streamlines the CI process, allowing the team to concentrate primarily on app development without getting bogged down by infrastructure concerns.
